# Four Track Recorder - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to Four Track! This guide will help you create your first multi-track recording in just a few minutes.

## What is Four Track?

Four Track is a 4-track audio recorder for your Ableton Move running Move Anything. Think of it like a classic cassette 4-track recorder, but integrated with Signal Chain patches so you can use any of your synths and effects.

With Four Track, you can:
- Layer up to 4 different instrument tracks
- Record up to 2 minutes per track (5 minutes max)
- Use different synth patches on each track
- Play back your recordings while adding new parts
- Mix and balance your tracks with levels and panning

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
1. Move Anything installed on your Move
2. The Four Track module installed
3. The Signal Chain module with some patches (for sound sources)

## Your First Recording

### Step 1: Launch Four Track

1. Enter Move Anything on your Move
2. Select **Four Track** from the menu
3. You'll see the main view with 4 empty tracks

```
Four Track        [-] 0:00.0
  T1: Empty
> T2: Empty
  T3: Empty
  T4: Empty
BPM:120 | Loop:Off
```

### Step 2: Load a Sound

1. Track 1 should already be selected (highlighted)
2. Press the **Menu** button to open the patch browser
3. Use the **Jog wheel** to scroll through available patches
4. When you find a patch you like, press the **Jog button** to load it
5. Press **Back** to return to the main view

Track 1 now shows your loaded patch name:
```
> T1: DX7 Piano
```

### Step 3: Arm the Track

Before recording, you need to "arm" the track:

1. Hold **Shift**
2. Press the **Record** button

The Track 1 LED turns red, and the Record button LED turns white. Track 1 is now armed!

### Step 4: Record!

1. Press the **Record** button (without Shift)
2. The Record LED turns red - you're recording!
3. Play some notes using the Move pads
4. When you're done, press **Record** again to stop

Track 1 now shows the recording length:
```
> T1: DX7 Piano              8.5s
```

### Step 5: Listen Back

Press **Play** to hear your recording. Press **Play** again to stop.

Congratulations - you've made your first recording!

## Adding More Tracks

Now let's add a second instrument:

### Step 6: Select Track 2

Press the **Track 2** row button (or use the Down arrow).

### Step 7: Load a Different Sound

1. Press **Menu** to open the patch browser
2. Select a different patch (maybe a bass or pad)
3. Press the Jog button to load
4. Press **Back**

### Step 8: Record Track 2

1. Arm Track 2 (Shift + Record)
2. Press **Record** to start
3. Track 1 will play back while you record Track 2!
4. Play your new part along with Track 1
5. Press **Record** to stop

Now you have two tracks playing together!

## Mixing Your Tracks

After recording, you'll want to balance your tracks:

### Quick Mix

- **Master Knob**: Adjusts level of the currently selected track
- An overlay shows the current value

### Full Mixer

1. Press **Menu** twice to enter Mixer view
2. Use **Knobs 1-4** for track levels
3. Use **Knobs 5-8** for panning (stereo position)
4. Press **Back** to return to main view

### Mute and Solo

- **Step 1-4**: Mute tracks 1-4 (press again to unmute)
- **Shift + Step 1-4**: Solo tracks 1-4 (hear only that track)

## Tips for Better Recordings

### Use the Metronome

If you're recording music with a beat:
1. Set your tempo with Left/Right arrows
2. Enable the metronome before recording
3. This helps keep all your tracks in time

### Plan Your Arrangement

A typical arrangement might be:
- **Track 1**: Drums or beat
- **Track 2**: Bass
- **Track 3**: Chords or pads
- **Track 4**: Melody or lead

### Monitor Your Levels

Watch the level bars on each track. If they're always at maximum, your mix might clip. Lower individual track levels to leave headroom.

## Common Tasks

### Clear a Track and Re-record

If you make a mistake:
1. Select the track you want to clear
2. Use the clear function to erase the recording
3. Arm and record again

### Change a Track's Patch

1. Select the track
2. Open the patch browser (Menu)
3. Load a new patch

Note: This doesn't change existing recordings, only what you record next.

### Start Over

To clear everything:
1. Clear each track individually
2. Or restart the module
