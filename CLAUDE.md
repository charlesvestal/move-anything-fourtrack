## Project Overview

Four Track is a 4-track audio recorder module for Move Anything that integrates with Signal Chain patches for sound generation.

## Architecture

```

## Key Implementation Details

### DSP Plugin (fourtrack.c)

Implements Move Anything plugin_api_v1:
- `on_load`: Initialize 4 track buffers (60s each), scan patches
- `on_unload`: Free buffers, unload synth
- `on_midi`: Forward MIDI to loaded synth
- `set_param`: Track control, transport, patch loading
- `get_param`: Track state queries
- `render_block`: Mix all tracks, record armed track

### Track System

Each track has:
- 60 second stereo buffer (malloc'd on load)
- Associated chain patch name
- Level, pan, mute, solo controls
- Recording length in samples

### Transport

Three states:
- `TRANSPORT_STOPPED`: No playback
- `TRANSPORT_PLAYING`: All tracks play back
- `TRANSPORT_RECORDING`: Armed track records, others play

### Signal Chain Integration

- Dynamically loads synth modules via dlopen
- Uses same subplugin host API as chain_host.c
- Only one synth active at a time (for armed track)
- Records synth output to track buffer

### UI Module (ui.js)

Three views:
- Main: Track list with status, transport display
- Patch: Chain patch browser with jog navigation
- Mixer: Visual faders for level/pan

Uses shared utilities from move-anything:
- menu_layout.mjs for headers/footers/lists
- constants.mjs for MIDI CC mappings
- input_filter.mjs for capacitive touch filtering

## Build Commands

```bash
./scripts/build.sh      # Build for ARM64 via Docker
./scripts/install.sh    # Deploy to Move device
```

## Key Constants

Audio:
- SAMPLE_RATE: 44100 Hz
- FRAMES_PER_BLOCK: 128
- MAX_RECORD_SECONDS: 60
- NUM_TRACKS: 4

MIDI:
- Track rows: CC 40-43
- Knobs 1-8: CC 71-78
- Master: CC 79
- Play: CC 85
- Record: CC 118

## Dependencies

- move-anything host runtime
- Signal Chain module (for patches)
- Docker (for cross-compilation)
